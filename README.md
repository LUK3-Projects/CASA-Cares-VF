# CASA-Cares-VF
Venue finder app developed for CC non-business use
This is an app designed for BTM 495 section AA under guidance of professor Ka Pong Law. 
Our team consists of  Chlo√© LeLann, Aaron Xu, Matthew Basmadjian, Jordan Meisels, Naomi Hirsch and Lucas Peters. 

The main goal of this app is to help combat the redudancy in repeated research within CASA Cares when searching for a venue and stream-line the process all together. 
There are two app logins so far for demonstration purposes:
Username: Admin | Password: password1
Username: Worker | Password: password2
